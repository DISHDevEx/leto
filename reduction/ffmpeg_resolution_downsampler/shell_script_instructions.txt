Reduction module - ffmpeg_resolution_downsampler.py deployment in AWS EC2 with shell scripts:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The reduction module - https://github.com/DISHDevEx/leto/tree/main/reduction/ffmpeg_resolution_downsampler - is used to take the input video file from the source S3 path, reduce the resolution,
label it, and then upload the processed video to the destination S3 path.

The module is deployed using shell scripts in Dish AWS - EC2 instance as per the below steps.

1.Create an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance manually with the following configuration in the Dish AWS account with Account ID: 064047601590,

a)Instance Name: Leto_Reduction_ffmpeg_resolution_downsampler

b)Instance Type: t3.small

c)AMI: amzn2-ami-kernel-5.10-hvm-2.0.20230628.0-x86_64-gp2

d)Keypair: Leto_DishTaasAdminDev_EC2.pem

e)VPC Id: vpc-0eb0f6cc5c4f183c0

f)Subnet Id: subnet-076928872d38e3063

g)Auto-assign public IP: Disable

h)Security group: sg-09141b3415e566e1a

i)IAM Role: SessionManager-064047601590-us-east-1-EC2Role

2.Save the ‘setup_and_run_ffmpeg_resolution_downsampler.sh’ file in the EC2 working directory. 

3.Provide execution permissions with to the shell script using this command - ‘chmod +x setup_and_run_ffmpeg_resolution_downsampler.sh’ and then execute it.

4.Post script execution, validate the changes by checking if the processed video files are uploaded to the respective destination S3 path.
  You can cross-check the file list in that target path by comparing the file names in the source S3 path.
