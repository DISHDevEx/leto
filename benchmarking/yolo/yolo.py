        Attributes
        ----------
        model: YOLO
            The yolo model imported from ultralytics
        model_weight: str
            The path to the model weight.

        Methods
        ----------
        get_model_weight -> str:
            A getter for the yolo weight.
        load_model_weight -> None:
            Load in model weight locally.
        train -> None:
            Train the model based on the input.

        The data can be inputted with many format; it can be a video, an image and even a list of images.
        It can also take in an entire directory path.

        Natively, if a video and 'save=True' is passed in as a parameter, then yolo will save the video as avi.
        Therefore, the pipeline.py will only pass in each frame in this method, so we can customize and save the result for our own use cases.

        Parameters
        ----------
            data: str
                The path of the desired data.
