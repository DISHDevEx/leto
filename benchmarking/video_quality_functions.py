        This will help to calculate PSNR for video having any resolution
            PSNR is Peak Signal to Noise ratio  which is used o measure the quality of a reconstructed or compressed image or video signal
            compared to its original, uncompressed version.
            It provides a quantitative measure of the fidelity of
            the reconstructed signal by calculating the ratio
            between the maximum possible signal power (peak signal)
            and the power of the distortion or noise introduced
            during the compression or reconstruction process.
